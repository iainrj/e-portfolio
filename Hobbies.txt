    Technology
**************
 My interest in technology is far reaching and Computer Science has been a great help 
 in learning more and more about it. 

 I hope from the course I will be ideally placed to gain employment in the technology sector. 
 A great interest of mine is finding ways to bring together technology and other sectors 
 such as sports, medicine and other places where tech could improve the lives of people.

 I am also very interested in transhumanism and the philosophical ideas surrounding how 
 in the future technology could be actually a part of us, even more so than today.


    Music
*********
 I am an avid musician, and have been playing the bass guitar for around 3 years with and
 without a band. I also listen to all different types of music and love seeing my favorite
 bands liven whenever possible.


    Sports
**********
 I love cycling and use it as my main form of transport but I also cycle for fun as much as
 possible. I also play snooker and football on a regular basis. My love of sports stretches 
 further than playing but also watching either live or on television.
