	- Academic Strengths
		-- Good teamworker

			  I always try and listen to other peoples ideas and change my views accordingly.
		-- Good public speaker
			- I've got no problem speaking to large groups and have experience doing presentations.
		-- Self motivated
			- I am motivated to do projects outside those needed for my course and during the university 
			  course am good at motivating myself to do work to a high quality and punctually.
		-- Good problem solving skills
			- I love to solve problems, not just in a Computer Science sense and am always willing to

	- Personal Strengths
		-- Good time management
			- My work is almsot always punctual and I am good at working to deadlines and planning my
			   work to reach those deadlines.
		-- Friendly
			- I am friendly and always willing to help others whenever I can.
		-- Curious
			- I think one of my biggest strengths is my curiousity as it leads me to learn and
			  investigate further than most. For me it is not usually enough to learn something and take it 
			  as fact; I will want to go into more depth about that subject.
